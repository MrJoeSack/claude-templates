# Practical Development Habits

Simple guidelines for AI-assisted development that actually work.

## Commit Often

Commit your changes frequently. Think of commits as save points.

- Commit after each small working change
- Write clear commit messages that explain what changed
- Don't wait until everything is perfect
- If you break something, you can always go back

Example good commits:
- "Add user login validation"
- "Fix navbar mobile layout"
- "Update API error handling"

## Write Less Code

Before writing new code, look for existing code that does something similar.

- Copy and modify existing functions
- Use the same patterns you see in the codebase
- Don't reinvent things that already work
- When in doubt, ask: "Is there already code that does this?"

## Keep It Simple

- Use plain language in code comments
- Avoid complex abstractions unless necessary
- Choose readable code over clever code
- If it's hard to explain, it's probably too complex

## Work in Small Steps

- Make one change at a time
- Test each change before moving to the next
- If something breaks, you'll know exactly what caused it
- Small changes are easier to review and understand

## Use What's There

- Check existing files for patterns before creating new ones
- Use the same libraries and tools the project already uses
- Follow the naming conventions you see
- If the project uses specific frameworks or patterns, stick with them

## Ask for Context

When working with AI assistants:
- Show relevant existing code
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish
- Point out any constraints or requirements
- Don't assume the AI knows your project structure

Remember: Good code is code that works and that other people can understand and modify.
